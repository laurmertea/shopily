            <h3>Welcome to your tech assessment!</h3>
            
            <p>
                Today you will be creating a little shopping list tool. Even though it's a simple exercise, the deliverable tells us a lot about your technical abilities. 
                Please make sure the shopping list can do the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
            
                <li>Add items</li>
                <li>Delete items</li>
                <li>Edit items</li>
                <li>Mark items as checked</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Things to note:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>You are free to decide how it exactly looks like and works, as long as you will use at least HTML, CSS, Vanilla PHP, MySQL & JS.</li>
                <li>You are allowed to pull in third-party libraries via composer, if needed, as well as npm (or a similar JS dependency manager), if needed.</li>
            </ul>
