Initial version
---------------

Welcome to your RoomRaccoon tech assessment!

Today you will be creating a little shopping list tool. Even though it's a simple exercise, the deliverable tells us a lot about your technical abilities. 
Please make sure the shopping list can do the following:

Add items
Delete items
Edit items
Mark items as checked

Things to note:
You are free to decide how it exactly looks like and works, as long as you will use at least HTML, CSS, Vanilla PHP, MySQL & JS.
You can allowed to pull in third-party libraries via composer if needed as well as npm (or a similar JS dependency manager) if needed
When sending the final product please send us the URL where deployed and the codebase of the shopping list when you're done.
